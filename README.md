# RPharma_Rhino_Workshop
Simple repository for a Rhino application showcasing validation readiness

## Goal
The goal is to use the `dm` dataset from `pharmaversesdtm` package and build a simple application using Rhino.

The app should show a table, let us sort the columns. If a column that is being sorted has a date, it should show us a date selector. Else, it should show a message in the header.

There also needs to be a way to reset the table.
